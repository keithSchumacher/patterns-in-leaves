# 202406201810 Thoughts on Methods of Information Geometry by Amari and Nagaoka

My interest in information geometry was sparked by a conversation with ChatGPT. We were discussing information spread in complex environments such as drone swarms and coupled dynamical systems. I wanted to model the information and environment using a similar  framework used to construct exciton-phonon systems. 

However, I don’t currently have a strong enough grasp on the physics and math to abstract the approach and apply it to a different field. ChatGPT recommended a course of study. Browsing through the suggested subjects and materials I thought Methods of Information Geometry by Shun-ichi Amari and Hiroshi Nagaoka seemed like an interesting and approachable first step. Actually Millner’s Morse Theory was my first attempt to crack into the project in December 2023. But a stressful work situation, job change, vacations, covid, and a lack of discipline and structure lead my learning and thinking on the subject to unravel into disorder.

This current attempt to work through Methods of Information Geometry is me taking another shot at a project that has been a lifelong interest for me. It is also an attempt at getting over the hurdle of independent physics and mathematical study at the graduate  level. This is a difficult barrier as it represents a drastic shift from the regimented and curated study that characterized my school-based education (from grade school through a physics BS and applied math MS). It is the barrier preventing me from exploring rich ideas with the tools I have available. I believe this is an important step in my deep work, Individuation, actualization journey (a journey that is the core of Patterns in Leaves). 

Below are my thoughts, questions and tangents from chapter 1. I plan to explore some of these in separate posts. It is possible these notes could form an incomplete and sporadic companion guide to someone else working through the book.

- Why do some manifolds (ex. Sphere and torus) not have a global coordinate system?
- What is the difference between a global and local coordinate system?
- I would like to find some examples and exercises to get comfortable with coordinate transformations.
- What is an open subset?
- If $\lambda$ is an injection between two manifolds $S$ and $Q$ with coordinate systems $\phi: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\psi: Q \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ and $n \neq m$, what does that mean? Is there a a lower dimensional representation of $S$ (if $n \lt m$ )?
- Examples of directional derivatives on manifolds. 





- [ ] Reference the actual Milner book
- [ ] Get correct word for Individuation
